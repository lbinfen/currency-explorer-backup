     ssccpp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data
     transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security
     as ssh(1).  ssccpp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed
     for authentication.

     File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the
     file is to be copied to/from that host.  Local file names can be made
     explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid ssccpp treating file
     names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.  Copies between two remote hosts
     are also permitted.

     The options are as follows:

     --11      Forces ssccpp to use protocol 1.

     --22      Forces ssccpp to use protocol 2.

     --33      Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local
             host.  Without this option the data is copied directly between
             the two remote hosts.  Note that this option disables the
             progress meter.

     --44      Forces ssccpp to use IPv4 addresses only.

     --66      Forces ssccpp to use IPv6 addresses only.

     --BB      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).

     --CC      Compression enable.  Passes the --CC flag to ssh(1) to enable com‐
             pression.

     --cc _c_i_p_h_e_r
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
             option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     --FF _s_s_h___c_o_n_f_i_g
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for sssshh.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     --ii _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y___f_i_l_e
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
             ssh(1).

     --ll _l_i_m_i_t
             Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

     --oo _s_s_h___o_p_t_i_o_n
             Can be used to pass options to sssshh in the format used in
             ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which
             there is no separate ssccpp command-line flag.  For full details of
             the options listed below, and their possible values, see
             ssh_config(5).

     --PP _p_o_r_t
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that
             this option is written with a capital ‘P’, because --pp is already
             reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file.

     --pp      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
             original file.

     --qq      Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and
             diagnostic messages from ssh(1).

     --rr      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that ssccpp follows sym‐
             bolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

     --SS _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
             Name of _p_r_o_g_r_a_m to use for the encrypted connection.  The program
             must understand ssh(1) options.

     --vv      Verbose mode.  Causes ssccpp and ssh(1) to print debugging messages
             about their progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,
             authentication, and configuration problems.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The ssccpp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     sshd(8)

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     ssccpp is based on the rcp program in BSD source code from the Regents of
     the University of California.
